This dashboard provides insight into multiple jobholding trends in the United States. The table on the dashboard shows that the prevalence of multiple jobholding has been increasing slowly but steadily over the past several years. The dashboard also allows users to investigate the changing demographic makeup of multiple jobholders as a group. Notably, individuals between 20 and 24 years old had the highest participation rate in multiple jobholding between 2014 and 2018. However, in 2019, we see that individuals between 25 and 54 begin participating at a similar rate. This may be further proof of the growth of multiple jobholding. In all years, married individuals are least likely to participate in multiple jobholding than are individuals of other marital statuses. Further, white and Black individuals are more likely to participate in multiple jobholding than are Asian or Hispanic/Latino individuals. 

The data used in this program come from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. An individual is classified as a multiple jobholder if they held more than one job at the time that they particpated in the Current Population Survey. Multiple jobholders do not include individuals who perform unpaid family work or are self-employed as their primary or secondary job.
